# User Manual: FX Journal Web

## Overview
**FX Journal Web** is a professional trading journal designed to help you plan, execute, and review your trades with precision.

## Core Concepts

### The Two-Phase Trade Lifecycle
Unlike simple loggers, this app treats every trade as a process:
1.  **Phase 1: Planning (Pre-Trade)**
    *   You define your entry, stop loss, target, and strategy *before* the trade triggers.
    *   Required: **Setup Chart** (visualize your idea).
    *   Status: `Planned`.
2.  **Phase 2: Execution (Post-Trade)**
    *   You log the actual outcome (Win/Loss), PnL, and lessons learned.
    *   Required: **Result Chart** (what actually happened).
    *   Status: `Closed`.
